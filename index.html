      <strong>Hi Everyone!</strong> I am Aariya Maharjan. You are welcome to my portfolio.<br><br>
      I am currently in my 2nd year of the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program. My passion lies in Full Stack Development<br><br>
      I love working on both the frontend and backend to build complete, user-friendly web applications.<br><br>
      So far, I have been building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm also diving into databases like MySQL to strengthen my backend skills.<br><br>
      I enjoy turning ideas into real, functional projects, and Iâ€™m always curious to learn new technologies. My goal is to gain hands-on experience through real-world projects and grow into a confident, industry-ready developer.<br><br>
      Feel free to explore my work and journey!
